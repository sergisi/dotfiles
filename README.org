#+title: Dotfiles for hyprland

[[file:assets/end-result.png]]

* Packages installed
I have a lot of packages installed, and a lot of dependencies for them, so some
of them maybe useless, but they can be found at packages.txt. To install them:

#+begin_src txt
yay -S (echo (cat packages | awk '{print $1}'))
#+end_src


* Config files
There is also a lot of configuration under the hood, like setting up:
+ nwg-look with catppuccin
+ ssdm and autologin
+ grub with catppuccin


At the end, just visit [[github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin]] and try get the apps that are not currently installed

* Spotifyd
This needs a file at ~.config/spotifyd/spotifyd.conf~ that contains this:
#+begin_src yml
[global]
username = ??
password = ??
#+end_src
